# CMPSC 465
## Penn State University Fall 2016
My project for CMPSC 465, taught by [Dr. Kamesh Madduri](www.cse.psu.edu/~kxm85/). The course website can be found [here](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~kxm85/teaching/CMPSC465/).

## Rosalind
These are my files from my CMPSC 465 homework. For the assignment, we were required to complete 33 data structures and algorithms problems on http://rosalind.info/

For practice, I completed about half of the questions in C++ and the other half in Java. The questions I completed using C++ were developed using XCode. Those completed in Java were developed using IntelliJ IDEA.
